This repo contains quick to configure raspberry pi python configurations to at least start up. Works on all versions.


1.First of all, with the Pi switched off, you’ll need to connect the Camera Module to the Raspberry Pi’s camera port, then start up the Pi and ensure the software is enabled.

2.Start up the Pi and open the Raspberry Pi Configuration Tool from the main menu.Ensure the camera software is enabled.

3.Now your camera is connected and the software is enabled, you can get started by trying out the camera preview.
Open Python 3 from the main menu.Open a new file and save it as camera.py. It’s important that you do not save it as picamera.py.
